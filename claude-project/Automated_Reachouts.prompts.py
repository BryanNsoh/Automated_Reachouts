        <p>I am currently engaged in several exciting projects at the intersection of machine learning, data science, and environmental science, including developing an <a href="https://github.com/BryanNsoh/ML-IOT-IndepStudy/blob/main/VWClstm_daily_injection.ipynb">LSTM model for soil moisture trend prediction</a>, creating from scratch a <a href="https://github.com/BryanNsoh/Datalogger2Cloud">repository for remotely deploying 150+ environmental sensors and dataloggers for real time data collection</a>, implementing a <a href="https://github.com/BryanNsoh/FuzzyLogic">fuzzy logic inference system for irrigation scheduling</a>, and working on a <a href="https://github.com/BryanNsoh/Automated_Lit_Revs">personal project to automate systematic literature reviews at scale</a>. I am passionate about these projects and believe they have the potential to make a significant impact.</p>

        <p>I am eager to explore how my skills in machine learning and sensor data processing could contribute to your work on using satellite data to monitor crop stress and optimize irrigation practices. My background in LSTM modeling and fuzzy logic inference systems could provide valuable insights to your projects.</p>

        <p>I am interested in potential PhD or internship opportunities with your research group. I have attached my CV for your consideration.</p>

        <p>Thank you for your time and attention.</p>

        <p>Best regards,<br>Bryan Nsoh<br><a href="mailto:bnsoh2@huskers.unl.edu">bnsoh2@huskers.unl.edu</a></p>
